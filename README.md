## acknowledgements

dwl began by extending the TinyWL example provided (CC0) by the sway/wlroots
developers. This was made possible in many cases by looking at how sway
accomplished something, then trying to do the same in as suckless a way as
possible.

Many thanks to suckless.org and the dwm developers and community for the
inspiration, and to the various contributors to the project, including:

- **Devin J. Pohly for creating and nurturing the fledgling project**
- Alexander Courtis for the XWayland implementation
- Guido Cella for the layer-shell protocol implementation, patch maintenance,
  and for helping to keep the project running
- Stivvo for output management and fullscreen support, and patch maintenance
